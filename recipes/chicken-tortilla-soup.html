    <h1>Chicken Tortilla Soup</h1>
    <img src="chicken-tortilla-soup-image.webp" alt="chicken tortilla soup">
    <h2>Please follow this recipe if you want to taste this incredible chicken tortilla soup.</h2>
    <p>My chicken tortilla soup is not a fast recipe, but it is one of the greatest chicken soup 
    experiences known to man. The smoky, spicy, slowly simmered tomato chicken broth is made from 
    scratch, and the soup is topped with all your favorite garnishes: toasted tortilla strips, sour 
    cream, avocado, cilantro, lime, and crumbled Mexican cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 1/2 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>3 white onions, halved, divided</li>
        <li>1 bunch cilantro, rinsed well</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken, 1 onion, stems from the cilantro bunch, bay leaves, oregano, peppercorns
        , dried chili pods, and 3 quarts of water in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Bring
         to simmer, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the tortilla strips: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
        Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cut tortillas in half, and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. Transfer tortilla strips
        to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Add salt and toss well to coat, then 
        spread strips out as evenly as possible.</li>
    </ol>
